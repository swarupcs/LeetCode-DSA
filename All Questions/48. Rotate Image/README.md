## 48. Rotate Image


https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/


```
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
```

#### Example 1:
![alt text](image.png)
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

```

#### Example 2:
![alt text](image-1.png)
```
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

#### Constraints:
```
n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 20
-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000
```

## Solutions
### Algorithm / Intuition
Intuition: By observation, we see that the first column of the original matrix is the reverse of the first row of the rotated matrix, so thatâ€™s why we transpose the matrix and then reverse each row, and since we are making changes in the matrix itself space complexity gets reduced to O(1).
### Approach:

Step 1: Transpose the matrix. (transposing means changing columns to rows and rows to columns)

Step 2: Reverse each row of the matrix.
* **Java**

```
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
		TransposeMatrix(matrix);
        Reverse(matrix);
    }

    public static void Reverse(int[][] arr) {
	    int n = arr.length;
	    int m = arr[0].length;
	    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	        for (int j = 0; j < m / 2; j++) { // Iterate only over half of the columns
	            int temp = arr[i][j];
	            arr[i][j] = arr[i][m - j - 1];
	            arr[i][m - j - 1] = temp;
	        }
	    }
	}
	
	public static void TransposeMatrix(int[][] arr) {
		for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
			for(int j=i+1; j<arr[0].length; j++) {
				int temp = arr[i][j];
				arr[i][j] = arr[j][i];
				arr[j][i] = temp;
			}
		}
		
	}
}
