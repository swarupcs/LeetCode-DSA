## 14. Longest Common Prefix


https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".



#### Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

#### Constraints:
```
1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
```

## Solutions


#### Horizontal Scanning Approach
```

The objective is to discover the longest common prefix by horizontally scanning each letter in the array of strings one at a time. You can get the LCP by doing the following:

LCP(S1...SN) = LCP(S1, S2, S3,...., SN)

Algorithm:

1. From S1 through SN, iterate through the string one at a time.
2. For each iteration till ith index, the LCP(S1â€¦Si) can be obtained.
3. End the loop and return the empty string if the LCP is empty.
4. Otherwise, keep going, and you can get the LCP(S1...SN) after scanning N strings.

* **Java**

```
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        if(strs.length == 0) {
            return "";
        }
        String commonPrefix = strs[0];
        for(int i=0; i<strs.length; i++) {
            while(strs[i].indexOf(commonPrefix) != 0) {
                commonPrefix = commonPrefix.substring(0,commonPrefix.length() - 1);
                if(commonPrefix.isEmpty()) {
                    return "";
                }
            }
        }
        return commonPrefix;
    }
}

```

Time Complexity: 
O(N) where N is the size of the array S[].

Space Complexity: 
O(1), as no extra space is used.
